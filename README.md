# Chinese-Chatbot-Game-Project

Status -- In Development

Current Implementation:
I/O functionality is used to implement the question-answer functionality of the game which also checks the validity of user answers, tracks user performance, and responds to user input accordingly with programmed & randomized responses. Users can manually create or load in new study sets to use. The game is intended to function somewhat similarly to chatbot, in that you navigate through the menus and play the game by essentially engaging in conversations with the computer and answering the corresponding prompts.
Prior to implementing the game, I did a lot of side research because I wanted to implement a simple GUI which is a task not frequently undertaken in C. I ended up stumbling up the header file <n.curses> which I read extensive documentation on in order to implement the menus and basic GUI.

Future Considerations:
The game is only in its first iteration, as I have a growing list of new features I intend to implement during my free time such as improved performance tracking, the ability to edit study sets directly through the main manu, and a way to track and further review questions that the user answered incorrectly.
